# PreToolUse hook (orchestration-kit) for Read|Grep and Bash: OPTIONAL secrets guard. A session never reads a
# key store: the paths the project lists under `never_read:` in docs/orchestration/ORCHESTRATION.md are refused
# for the Read tool, for Grep (a search inside one, or one that would sweep through one), and for a Bash command
# whose text names one (cat, less, gpg, cp ... anything). A key a session needs is the human's job to supply.
#
# NO-OP (exit 0, no output) unless ALL hold:
#   - the session's repo carries the opt-in marker docs/orchestration/.kit-hooks;
#   - docs/orchestration/ORCHESTRATION.md has a `never_read:` block with at least one `- <path>` line below it
#     (the list is the switch: no list, no guard). `~` means the home directory; a directory covers everything
#     beneath it; an entry with `*` is a shell pattern matched against the whole path (e.g. `- *.pem`).
# Both are read from the MAIN checkout (first `git worktree list` entry), so linked worktrees follow it.
# Optional `allow_read:` block (same format): one FILE by its exact path (`~` = home) is let through although a
# never_read entry covers it, until the human removes the line: a Read of exactly that path, a Grep of that one
# file, and a Bash command naming it (K below; "K" and 'K' count as K) in one of these shapes only:
#   NAME=K [NAME2=v ...] <program> <args>          (env, timeout N before it are fine)
#   export NAME=K; <program> <args>                 (or &&)
#   cat K                                           (with | wc -c, | head -c N)
# each optionally after `cd <dir> &&`, with redirections (2>&1, > file) and a last pipe into wc, head or tail.
# Every other word is plain: no other $ of any kind, no quote, backslash, backtick, glob, brace or parenthesis,
# no second K, and none of find, [[, for, select, case, set, declare, typeset, local, readonly, function, alias,
# eval, source, ., read, mapfile, readarray, xargs, exec. Any other command naming K is refused (its message
# names the shapes); one in shape is then checked as any command, K blanked out (a listed path left in it,
# e.g. `cd <listed folder> &&`, is refused). Anything else under never_read stays refused: the folder, a
# sibling, a glob, a `..`, `.` or `//` spelling (the allow match is on the exact spelling, so normalizing only
# ever refuses more).
# An allow entry that is a directory, a symlink, a pattern (* ? [) or not a plain absolute path is ignored.
# Paths are compared NORMALIZED, on both sides (the entries and the path a tool names), by text alone (no
# filesystem access): `~`, `$HOME` and `${HOME}` expanded, `//` collapsed, `.` dropped, `..` resolved, a trailing
# `/` dropped. A relative path is resolved against the call's working directory: the hook input's `cwd` (Read,
# Grep and Bash calls carry it), else CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR; when neither is known a relative path is refused. In a
# Bash command every path-like word (holding a `/`, starting with `~` or `$HOME`, or `.`/`..`) is checked that way,
# a relative one also against each `cd`/`pushd` target in the same command; the call's own `cwd` is one of the
# words, so a command run inside a listed path is refused too. The command's words are read twice: split at
# quotes and operators as before, and as bash splits them (JSON escapes decoded, quotes removed and the quoted and
# plain pieces of one word joined: "$HOME"/.netrc, ~/'a'/b; \x outside quotes = x; $'..' and $".." read as '..'
# and ".."; a word that is itself a command, as in bash -c '..', sh -c "..", "$(..)", is split again, three
# levels deep; each word is checked whole and in its pieces around = @ : ,). cd targets chain: a relative one is
# resolved against the cd before it as well as the working directory (cd a && cd b = a/b); a bare `cd` goes home;
# -L/-P/-e/-@ flags are skipped. `~` inside quotes is taken as home too (bash would not expand it: refuses more).
# It is a speed bump for an agent, not a sandbox: a path reached through a variable, a glob in the folder part
# (`secre*/`) or in the file-name part of a file entry (`~/.net*`), brace expansion (`~/.{netrc,x}`), `~user`,
# escapes inside $'..' (\x2f), a directory flag other than cd/pushd (`tar -C`, `git -C`, `env -C`, `make -C`),
# `cd -`, a command nested deeper than three levels, a symlink (links are not followed) or a script is not seen,
# nor what the program does with K once it has it (a script or interpreter that derives the folder from the
# NAME=K value, a file it writes that a later command runs). Known gaps, by choice: pattern entries are not
# checked in Bash commands (only on the paths Read and Grep name), and the Glob tool is not registered, so the
# file NAMES in a listed folder can be listed (never their contents). Deliberately no set -e: a hook must never
# break a tool call.
# Dependencies: bash, git, grep, sed, awk, sort.
#
# Test mode: SECRETS_GUARD_CONF=<file> and SECRETS_GUARD_HOME=<dir> skip the repo lookup and use that list.
